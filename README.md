This tools helps us deploy applications to our servers.

## ‚≠ê How it works

As part of a CI pipeline, the Deployer webhook is called:

```bash
curl "https://deployer.oswaldlabs.com/platform/GENERATED_PASSWORD"
```

Here, `GENERATED_PASSWORD` is replaced with an environment variable which has a deployment key.

Similarly, other services can be deployed, based on the [deployer.yml](https://github.com/OswaldLabsOpenSource/deployer/blob/master/deployer.yml) file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Compile Typescript to CommonJS before running the server:

```bash
yarn build
```

Run local server:

```bash
yarn start
```
